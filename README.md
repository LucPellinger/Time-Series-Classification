# Time-Series-Classification
This project aimed at exploring different deep learning architectures for time series classification. It includes a thoroughly implemented experimentation and evaluation pipeline as well as three corresponding DL architectures for multivariate time series classification. 

## ⚠️WARNING⚠️
This repository is currently imcomplete due to code maintance and pipeline debugging. Set a Star for further updates.
